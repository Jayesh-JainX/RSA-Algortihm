## Introduction

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that enables secure communication through encryption and decryption processes. This Java program demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption, allowing users to encrypt messages using a private key and decrypt messages using a public key.

## Features

- Generate RSA key pairs.
- Encrypt plain text messages using the private key.
- Decrypt encrypted messages using the public key.
- View generated RSA key pairs (public and private keys).
- Store and retrieve encrypted messages in/from a file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of RSA encryption and decryption.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-rsa-encryption.git

## Security Considerations

Please note the following important security considerations when using or modifying this code:

- This program is intended for educational purposes and serves as a basic introduction to user authentication and encryption concepts.
- The encryption and authentication methods used in this code are rudimentary and may not provide adequate security against modern threats.
- **Do not use this code as-is for handling sensitive information or in production systems.**

It's recommended to address the following concerns before using this code in any meaningful capacity:

- **Encryption**: While AES encryption is used, the encryption key generation and management are simplistic. Consider using a more robust key management strategy, such as a dedicated key management service.
- **Authentication**: This code lacks proper mechanisms for protecting against attacks like brute force and timing attacks. Implement more advanced authentication techniques.
- **Error Handling**: The code lacks comprehensive error handling, which is crucial for identifying and responding to unexpected scenarios securely.
- **Code Review**: Conduct a thorough security code review to identify potential vulnerabilities and address them.
- **Dependency Management**: Ensure all libraries and dependencies used are up to date and secure.

Remember that security is an ongoing process, and staying informed about the latest security practices is essential for creating secure software.
