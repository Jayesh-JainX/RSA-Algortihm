## Introduction

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that enables secure communication through encryption and decryption processes. This Java program demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption, allowing users to encrypt messages using a private key and decrypt messages using a public key.

## Features

- Generate RSA key pairs.
- Encrypt plain text messages using the private key.
- Decrypt encrypted messages using the public key.
- View generated RSA key pairs (public and private keys).
- Store and retrieve encrypted messages in/from a file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of RSA encryption and decryption.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-rsa-encryption.git
